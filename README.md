https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps/resource/37b2ac41-ae8e-4de1-8405-157e05dc3640

This dataset contains the speed humps in Pittsburgh under an ID, and the neighborhoods that the speed humps are in are a separate, idendifiable variable.

## Anne's dataset: "City of Pittsburgh Signalized Intersections"
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-signalized-intersections/resource/79ddcc74-33d2-4735-9b95-4169c7d0413d

This dataset lists all of the signalized intersections in Pittsburgh under an ID, and the neighborhoods that these intersections are in are a separate, idendifiable variable.

## Erin's dataset: "City of Pittsburgh Traffic Count"
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/6dfd4f8f-cbf5-4917-a5eb-fd07f4403167

This dataset consists of Pittsburgh traffic measurements via traffic counts. Each traffic count reflects how bad traffic is by neighborhood.

## These datasets are what InsertTeamName use to argue what the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is, going off the metric of "safest to own a car in".
